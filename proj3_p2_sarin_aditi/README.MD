- Run the file a_star_sarin_aditi.py to generate the nodes and paths through A-star Algorithm

- Input the clearance (preferrably 50mm)

- Input the start and goal points, you can use one of the following combinations
    start = (0.5, 1, 0), (0.3, 1.5, 0) , (0.2, 1.2, 0), (0.4, 0.9, 0)
    goal = (4.7, 1.5, 0), (5.5, 1.5, 0), (4.8, 0.7, 0), (5.1, 0.5, 0)

- Input left velocity between 60-70 rpm and right wheel velocity 120-140 rpm

- There will one output plot showing all the explored nodes and the shortest path

- The shortest path will also be printed in the terminal

- The path for the 'path.txt' file needs to be changed according to the system

- Commands to launch the turtlebot3
